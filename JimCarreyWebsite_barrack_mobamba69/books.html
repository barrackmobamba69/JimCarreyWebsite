            <p class="all-p">Carrey and Vachon met at an art studio and started collaborating via Twitter a decade
                prior to the book's release and the origins of their collaboration went back eight years that eventually
                incorporated several disparate interests such as Arthurian legend and the nature of reality into a
                satirical memoir. <br> <br> Additionally, the book is an outgrowth of Carrey's interest in the artifice
                of
                celebrity and the nature of the self, which developed after his own rise to fame. <br> <br> The novel
                was
                announced in October 2019 and after being slated for a May 2020 release, the book was pushed back to
                July due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
                The audio book version is narrated by Carrey's Dumb and Dumber co-star Jeff Daniels.

            <h1 class="all-h1">How Roland Rolls</h1>
            <p class="all-p">HOW ROLAND ROLLS, winner of a 2013 Gelett Burgess Children’s Book Award, is a story about a
                wave named Roland who's afraid that, one day, when he hits the beach, his life will be over. <br> <br>
                But when he
                gets deep, he's struck by the notion that he's not just a wave - he's the whole big, wide ocean! The
                story shows humanity's interconnectedness through the metaphor of a wave in the ocean. <br> <br>


                The book is lavishly illustrated by Rob Nason, who won a Golden Reel award for his work as Art Director
                on the film Anastasia, as well as an Annie Awards nomination. His work on Thumbelina garnered the Hans
                Christian Andersen award. <br> <br> His cover for the inspiring grass-roots children's book, Saltwater
                Taffy, was
                nominated as Cover of the Year and was a finalist for the prestigious Benjamin Franklin award.
