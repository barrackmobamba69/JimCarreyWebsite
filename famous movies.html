                <h1 class="all-h1">5. The Mask (1994)</h1>
                <p class="all-p">The impact of Carrey’s breakthrough year – in which he also released Ace Ventura: Pet
                    Detective and
                    Dumb and Dumber – was so seismic that people tend to forget how soggy and formless The Mask is.
                    Although Carrey gives it everything (director Chuck Russell claims that his rubbery face was worth a
                    million dollars in special effects), the film itself is essentially a loose collection of
                    catchphrases where a plot should be.</p>
                <p class="all-p">In 1994, a year that could be coined “the year of Carrey,” this was the performance that
                    earned him a
                    Golden Globe nomination for lead actor comedy, likely responding to its massive box office. His dancing
                    inflections and “smokin’” deliveries (alongside the birth of Cameron Diaz in cinema) still hold up
                    today.</p>

                <h1 class="all-h1">4. Liar Liar (1997)</h1>
            <p class="all-p">Comedy is one of the most under awarded and overlooked genres in cinema. Carrey’s
                dedication as an unethical lawyer and father who constantly disappoints his son is one of his best
                performances. From getting pulled over by a police officer to his insult round-about in the board room,
                the comedian shines brighter than ever before. It’s his one-person show with a blue pen that stands as
                his single best comedic moment ever.
            </p>
            <p class="all-p">Now, hear me out. Liar Liar might not have the dramatic heft of a Truman Show or an Eternal
                Sunset. And it might not have the all-out laser focus of Dumb and Dumber or Ace Ventura. But it is
                nevertheless Carrey’s best film. Imagine another actor trying to do what Carrey does here, essentially
                spending an hour and a half possessed by a spirit that prevents him from lying. Imagine how flat and
                uninteresting it would be. Now, go back and watch Liar Liar. Watch Carrey writhe and contort in the
                fruitless pursuit of a lie. Watch it take over his entire body. Better yet, this film gave him a family
                for the first time, rooting his mania in something identifiable. At this stage in his career, Carrey was
                pumping out films at a prodigious rate – this was his seventh in three years – and he was figuring out
                new moves at every turn. In Liar Liar, he figured out the impossible: how to be a human being.</p>

            <h1 class="all-h1">3. Dumb & Dumber (1994)</h1>
            <p class="all-p">It’s still unbelievable how well Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels make magic together in Peter
                Farrelly’s classic comedy. The humor can be merciless in its stupidity, like “the most annoying sound in
                the world” or the declaration of “goodbye my love” before crashing into another car. However, it’s
                Carrey’s long gaze at Harry betraying him that does it for me every time.
            </p>
            <p class="all-p">From this point onwards, every film is a classic. If Ace Ventura saw Jim Carrey kicking the
                door open, Dumb and Dumber absolutely nailed it to the wall. This is a truly stupid film in the best
                possible way; a road trip populated solely by total idiots. The things that Carrey does with a ketchup
                bottle alone in this film could fill entire dissertations. Despite this, what keeps the film watchable
                is the look of petrified delight in Jeff Daniels’s eyes throughout, as he tries to keep up with Carrey.
                It is as if he has accidentally caught his trousers on a speeding train. Dumb and Dumber was made for
                $17m. Such was its colossal success that, two years later, Carrey would be commanding pay cheques bigger
                than that.

            <h1 class="all-h1">2. Bruce Almighty (2003)</h1>
            <p class="all-p">Jim Carrey’s best comedy moments have been under the thumb of frequent collaborator Tom
                Shadyac, who always had a knack for capturing the comedian’s magic. Their partnership comes together
                nicely in this divine comedy, where Carrey’s chemistry with co-stars Jennifer Aniston and Morgan Freeman
                helped lead to another box office smash.
            </p>
            <p class="all-p">In 2020, a film that asked the question “What would Jim Carrey be like as God?” would be
                the most miserable thing in the world, but 2003 was a more optimistic time. Bruce Almighty is a
                gleaming, finely honed comedy that essentially removes all physical constraints from Carrey’s
                performance. He lassos the moon and brings it closer to him. He parts a soup, Moses-style. He causes
                Steve Carell to speak in tongues. Yes, there is a gloopy spiritualism that threatens to overwhelm the
                film towards the climax, but it remains one of the best vehicles for Carrey’s buffoonery.</p>

            <h1 class="all-h1">1. The Truman Show (1998)</h1>
            <p class="all-p">Compelling, funny and astutely tender, Jim Carrey’s first outing in the dramatic realm has
                him laying it all on the line for his art. It’s a home run. Teamed with the masterful Peter Weir and
                lavishly in tune with the magnanimous acting of Ed Harris, Laura Linney and Natascha McElhone, Truman
                Burbank goes down as one of his likable and empathetic characters. Unfortunately, after winning the
                Golden Globe for lead actor drama, no other televised precursors bit for a nomination. They just weren’t
                ready for what Carrey was selling, even if it was priceless.
            </p>
            <p class="all-p">This is the film where everything went right. The Truman Show has a crackerjack logline – a
                man realises that he has spent his life on a TV set as the unwitting star of a long-running series and
                tries to break free – an honest, sympathetic script that still allows space for Carrey to do his thing,
                and fastidiously unshowy direction. You sense that Carrey has always longed for a Groundhog Day; a
                high-concept movie packed with universal truths that allows him to be sincere and zany in equal measure.
                The Truman Show is not quite there, but it comes awfully close at times.
