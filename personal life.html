            <h1 class="all-h1">Early life</h1>
            <p class="all-p">Carrey grew up in and around Toronto. <br>
                At age eight he began making faces before a mirror and discovered a talent for doing impressions.
                <br>
                After leaving school in 1978 to help support his family, Carrey worked for two years as a janitor in
                a factory. <br>
                He made his professional debut as a stand-up comedian in a Toronto club at age 15 and by 1979 he was
                able to make a living as a comedian. <br>
                He wrote most of his own material as an opening act for such comics as Buddy Hackett and Rodney
                Dangerfield. <br>
                Known for his racing energy level and frenetic improvisation, he had a comic appeal that was mainly
                visual. <br>
                He was a technically brilliant mimic and boasted more than 100 characterizations, with a repertoire
                ranging from Humphrey Bogart to Kermit the Frog.

            <h1 class="all-h1">Middle Life</h1>
            <p class="all-p">At age 19 Carrey moved to Hollywood, where he acted in films and on television. <br>
                In 1983 he played a role in the Canadian television film Introducing…Janet. <br>
                The following year he made his feature film debut in Finders Keepers, which was followed by a
                leading role in the film Once Bitten (1985). <br>
                He scored an immediate hit with Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and had continued box-office success with
                Dumb and Dumber and The Mask (all 1994). <br>
                In the latter film Carrey played a timid bank clerk who becomes a hip wisecracking green-faced dandy
                when he dons a magical mask. <br>
                His performance earned Carrey the first of several Golden Globe Award nominations.

                article about a police officer investigating a murder. <br>
                He then starred as a popular children’s television show host coping with a recent tragedy in the
                television series Kidding (2018–20). <br>
                In 2020 Carrey returned to the big screen with the family comedy Sonic the Hedgehog. <br>

                briefly to Dumb & Dumber co-star Lauren Holly before entering a yearlong romance with his Me, Myself and
                Irene leading lady Renee Zellweger. <br> He was later involved with actress/model Jenny McCarthy. <br>
